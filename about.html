          The Project
        </h3>
        <p>Parlange coworking and beach club was founded on a dream, a seized opportunity and the belief that there is no such thing as taking a joke "too far". Though it is a stupid and likely to be short-lived, we aim to give our guest the best experience any coworking beach club can offer.</p>

        <h3>
          The Location
        </h3>
        <p>The house which hosts the Parlange Coworking and Beach Club has a rich and varied history.</p>
        <p>18th century</p>
        <p>The house was built following designs attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci. It later transpired that he had nothing to do with the plans but the house was well under way so they just went along with it.</p>
        <p>19th century</p>
        <p>This was the most tumultuous period for the house. It was first a monastery before becoming a brothel and then an orphonage. A few years later, it was turned back into a brothel.</p>
        <p>20th century</p>
        <p>The house was used to produce moonshine during the american prohibition period. They didn't export or sell it or anything, they just liked to make alocohol.</p>
        <p>21th century</p>
        <p>It is rumored that this is the house the Notorious B.I.G and Tupac met at to create their to-be-released album after they both faked their deaths.</p>
